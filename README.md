## Installation

```bash
npm i feathers-trigger
```

## Usage

Imagine you want to notify users when a `post` gets published.

How can this be done? In this example a `post` has a `publishedAt` property which shows when a `post` was published. A `post` with `publishedAt === null` means that the `post` is not published yet. A `post` can be created as a draft which is not published.

But how do you know when a `post` gets published? Sounds silly, but there are three possibilities:

- A `post` gets created with `publishedAt: { $ne: null }`.
- A `post` gets updated by **data** `publishedAt: { $ne: null }`, it had `publishedAt: null` before and the **result** really has `publishedAt: { $ne: null }`.
- A `post` gets patched by **data** `publishedAt: { $ne: null }`, it had `publishedAt: null` before and the **result** really has `publishedAt: { $ne: null }`.

How can this be accomplished?

1. Check `context.data` for `publishedAt: { $ne: null }` and if that's not true, the subscription is not true.
2. Check if the post in the database has `publishedAt === null` and therefore is not published yet. You need to check that in a `before` hook. If that's not true, the subscription is not true.
3. Check if the `context.result` really has `publishedAt: { $ne: null }` (maybe it's handled by another permission hook, or something). If that's not true, the subscription is not true.
4. If all three checks are true, run the `notify` function.

It's up to you how you define the `notify` action. For the example above the solution with `feathers-trigger` looks like the following:

```js
// posts.hooks.js
import { trigger } from "feathers-trigger";

const notifyPublished = trigger({
  data: { publishedAt: { $ne: null } },
  before: { publishedAt: null },
  result: { publishedAt: { $ne: null } },
  action: ({ item }, context) => {
    return context.app.service("/notify").create(item);
  },
});

export default {
  before: {
    create: [notifyPublished],
    update: [notifyPublished],
    patch: [notifyPublished],
  },
  after: {
    create: [notifyPublished],
    update: [notifyPublished],
    patch: [notifyPublished],
  },
};
```
